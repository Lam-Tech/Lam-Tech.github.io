## Overview
Lam tech is the organization created to WIN the meteor Hackathon and HACC.

## Covid Checker

Purpose
The purpose of this assignment is to prepare you for the Meteor hackathon. 
You must create a simple Meteor application for COVID tracking that is deployed to Galaxy (free tier). 

Software Development Practices.
You must work in a team and follow the Issue Driven Project Management practices taught in ICS 314.  Your source code must be available on GitHub in a public repository. You must use GitHub pages to document the user interface to your application and provide a link to the deployed application running on Galaxy's free tier.

Accounts
Users can register for an account using the built-in Meteor accounts package. 

Functionality
The first purpose of this app is to enable people to specify for the current day whether or not they are experiencing COVID symptoms. After logging in, users will be presented with a page similar to the Lumisight app which asks them to indicate whether or not they are not experiencing COVID-like symptoms.  Upon submission, the data about the day is stored. The user can resubmit the information for the current day at any time during the day, and the data will be updated for that day. 

The second purpose of this app is to provide a record of all submissions. This is a page that indicates all the dates (and times) where data has been submitted, and what the COVID status was on that day.

The third purpose of this app is to allow users to upload information about their vaccine status.  This data includes the dates when a vaccine was administered, the kind of vaccine, and the lot number.  Users can also upload a picture of their vaccine card.  You will need to use an image hosting service like Cloudinary, or a generic file storage service like Amazon S3.

## Covid Checker Milestones
Milestone-1 (Due Date: September 15, 11pm) : One member of your team should submit to this channel the link to your GitHub page describing your application. By this date, the application should be deployed to Galaxy, allow registration and login, and provide the ability to indicate (or update) your COVID status for the current day. 
The GitHub page should provide screenshots of all pages in the application and a description of how they work and indicate all team members.

Milestone-2 (Due Date: October 1, 11pm) : By this date, you must have completed all requirements for Milestone 1, plus there should be a new page that allows users to enter their vaccine status (but not a picture of their vaccine card, which is for milestone 3).
One member of your team should submit a link to this channel of your GitHub page for this project.  The page should provide details on the current user interface and a link to the deployed application, and indicate all team members.

Milestone-3 (Due Date: October 14, 11pm) : By this date, you should have completed all of the requirements for Milestones 1 and 2, plus your application should be able to upload a picture of a vaccine card and display it for the user. The GitHub page for the application should be updated with the latest user interface and link to the deployed application.
For Milestone 3, each member of the class must submit to this channel a link to an entry in your professional portfolio that describes the application you developed, provides links to the GitHub page and deployed application, what you learned from the experience, and what you personally contributed to the project.
